# Udon
Reava makes Udon stuff.

- **InteractSwitch**:
On interact, enables an array of gameOjbects, and disables a second array. Does NOT revert once pressed again, it SETS the state and is NOT synced.

- **PlayerListManager**:
Not ready for public use yet, this will be part of a prefab once ready.

- **TagAssigner**:
Just assigns a Tag to anyone who matches their username to the user Array of the behavior on world join. Local, also behaves like the InteractSwitch if your username matches.

- **TagTP**:
If you got the correct Tag to your name on interact with the behavior, teleports you to the target, if not, teleports you to the second target (or doesn't if empty / disabled)

- **reflectionprobeiscool**:
RelfectionProbes are cool! make them real time, scripted and add this script to change the frequency they refresh at !
